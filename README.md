# Tower of Hanoi Simulation

This project is a Tower of Hanoi simulation implemented using MonoGame, allowing users to visualize the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with a graphical interface.

## Introduction

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle involving three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules.

This simulation project provides a visual representation of the Tower of Hanoi problem, enabling users to interact with the simulation and observe the movement of disks between pegs.

## Features

- Visual representation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle
- Adjustable number of disks for the simulation
- Pause and resume functionality during the simulation
- Status display showing the current state (Running, Paused, Finished)
- Move counter to track the number of moves taken
